# Alpaca Integration Fix

This document provides the complete solution to fix the Alpaca integration issues in your AI trading application.

## 🚀 Quick Fix Summary

The main issues were:
1. API keys exposed in frontend
2. Missing backend environment setup
3. WebSocket server not running
4. CORS configuration issues

## 🔧 Backend Environment Setup

Since I can't create the `.env` file directly, you need to create it manually:

1. **Create file**: `ai-trading-app/backend/.env`
2. **Add content**:
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key_here
ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_alpaca_secret_key_here
```

## 📊 What You'll See

After starting all three servers:

1. **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
3. **WebSocket Server**: ws://localhost:4001
4. **Real Alpaca Data**: Your actual portfolio, positions, and market data
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live price updates via WebSocket
6. **Paper Trading**: Safe testing environment with real market data

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you see "Alpaca account creation is currently disabled":
- This message appears when the frontend can't connect to the backend
- Make sure all three servers are running
- Check that the backend is on port 3001
- Verify the `.env` file exists in the backend directory

### If you see WebSocket connection errors:
- The WebSocket server (port 4001) handles real-time data
- Make sure `node alpaca-realtime.js` is running
- Check that port 4001 is available
- Verify your API keys are correct

### If you see demo data:
- The app will fall back to demo data if the API calls fail
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your API keys are correct
- Ensure all three servers are running

### Common Issues:
1. **Port conflicts**: Make sure ports 3000, 3001, and 4001 are available
2. **Node.js not installed**: Install from https://nodejs.org/
3. **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm install` in both backend and frontend directories
4. **WebSocket server not running**: Start `node alpaca-realtime.js` in the backend directory

## 🎯 Expected Results

Once everything is working:
- ✅ Real account balance and portfolio value
- ✅ Current positions with P&L
- ✅ Live market data and quotes
- ✅ Real-time price updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Paper trading functionality
- ✅ No more "Alpaca account creation disabled" message
- ✅ No more WebSocket connection errors

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Your API keys are now stored securely in the backend
- Frontend no longer exposes API keys to the browser
- All Alpaca requests go through your backend server
- WebSocket connections are proxied through your server
- Paper trading environment is safe for testing

## 📈 Next Steps

1. Test the integration by logging into your dashboard
2. Verify real data is loading (not demo data)
3. Check that real-time updates are working (no WebSocket errors)
4. Try placing a paper trade
5. Explore the watchlist and market data features

## 🖥️ Server Architecture

Your app now runs **3 servers**:

1. **Backend API Server** (port 3001)
   - Handles REST API calls to Alpaca
   - Manages account data, orders, positions
   - Provides secure API key management

2. **WebSocket Server** (port 4001)
   - Handles real-time market data
   - Proxies Alpaca WebSocket connections
   - Provides live price updates

3. **Frontend Server** (port 3000)
   - Serves the React web application
   - Connects to both API and WebSocket servers
   - Provides the user interface

Your Alpaca integration should now work perfectly! 🚀
